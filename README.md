### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ali, and I develop web applications. I enjoy creating complex UIs and animations along with secure and scalable server code. I love learning new languages, frameworks, and technologies and using them in my projects. Frameworks that I currently use in my stack include React, Next, Qwik, and Svelte, along with Node.js for my servers. Languages that Iâ€™m currently learning are Rust and Go Lang.
